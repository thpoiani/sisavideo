# SisAVideo - Sistema Administrativo de Videoconferências

**SisAVideo** was a [Windows Presentation Foundation](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf) project developed in 2012 during an internship in the *Fundação do Desenvolvimento Administrativo (Fundap)*, sponsored by the *Programa Tecnologia para Rede de Escolas de Governo (TecReg)*.

This project aimed to manage videoconferences (syncing with Google Calendar), manage internships' time sheet, and report registration and attendance records.
